    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your `get_bow_from_doc` function, you will call each of those functions you created to clean up the HTML before you generate the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please use Python string operations and regular expression only in this lab. Do not use extra libraries such as `beautifulsoup` because otherwise you loose the purpose of practicing."
